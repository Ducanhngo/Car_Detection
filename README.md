## Introduction
Car detection is a critical task in computer vision, often used in self-driving cars, traffic monitoring systems, and parking management solutions. In this project, we aim to detect cars in images and video streams using an object detection algorithm such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detector), or Faster R-CNN.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled images of cars, including bounding box annotations. You can use datasets such as:
- [PASCAL VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/)
- [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/)
- [Udacity Self-Driving Car Dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car)

Make sure to split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Architecture
For car detection, several deep learning models can be utilized, including:
- **YOLOv10**: A real-time object detection model that is both fast and accurate.
- **Faster R-CNN**: A region-based convolutional neural network for object detection.
- **SSD**: A single-shot object detector that performs well on mobile devices.

### Example: YOLOv10
```python
# Download and install YOLOv10
!git clone https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10.git
%cd yolov10
!pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train the model on the car dataset
!python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data ./car_dataset.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
```

## Training
The model is trained using images and their corresponding bounding box annotations. Key steps in the training process include:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize the images and resize them to the input size required by the model.
2. **Augmentation**: Apply random image augmentations such as flips, rotations, and color changes to make the model robust.
3. **Training**: Use the preprocessed and augmented images to train the model.

```python
# Example code to train the model
import torch
from yolov10 import Model

model = Model(cfg='yolov5s.yaml')
model.train(data='car_dataset.yaml', epochs=50, batch_size=16)
```

## Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model on a test set to measure performance using metrics like:
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: Measures the precision of the model.
- **Intersection Over Union (IoU)**: Measures how well the predicted bounding boxes overlap with the ground truth.

```python
# Evaluate the model
!python val.py --weights best.pt --data car_dataset.yaml --img 640
```

## Usage
To use the trained model for car detection in real-time, you can run the following script:

```python
# Detect cars in a test image
!python detect.py --weights best.pt --img 640 --source ./test_images
```

For real-time detection using a webcam:
```python
# Real-time car detection
!python detect.py --weights best.pt --source 0  # '0' refers to the default webcam
```

## Requirements
To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key dependencies include:
- `torch`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`
- `pillow`

## Conclusion
This car detection project demonstrates how to use deep learning models for object detection. The model can be used for real-time applications such as surveillance or autonomous driving systems.
